# Character Vault

A server that provides a website and login system allowing players and staff to manage characters during play and provides an API for tools using them.

Currently supports Chronicles of Darkness and is used for Nashville Unveiled.  Slightly oriented toward LARP play, but not limited to CofD or LARP usage.

Created in 2021 for Vampire the Requiem after gameplay resumed post-pandemic.  Prior to lockdown we had been using paper, and during virtual play we migrated to Google Docs and things were tracked in a rather extensive spreadsheet.  That experience informed the creation of this.
